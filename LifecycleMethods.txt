Lifecycle Methods:
1.	constructor()                   -> done
2.	componentDidMount()             -> done
3.	componentWillMount()            -> done
4.	render()                        -> done
5.	componentWillReceiveProps()     -> done
6.	shouldComponentUpdate()         -> done
7.	componentWillUpdate()           -> done
8.	componentDidUpdate()            -> done
9.	componentDidCatch()
10.	componentWillUnmount()

LIFECYCLE METHODS WORKS ONLY IN STATEFULL COMPONENT AND NOT STATELESS ONES.

Not all these methods get executed while component creation. Only the first four does.

During Mounting:
constructor() -> componentWillMount() -> render() : will render the child components -> componentDidMount()

During updating: (which can happen with the change of state or props)
shouldComponentUpdate() (if it returns true...then) -> componentWillUpdate() -> render() : will render all child components
-> child's componentWillReceiveProps() -> componentDidUpdate()

During unmounting:
componentWillMount()

During error:
componentDidCatch()

**componentWillReceiveProps() doesn't get called during the mounting phase
